# Issue 22 Progress Details

- Implemented canonical repository-scoped Focus Board aggregation and `GET /api/focus-board`.
- Added live Today / Focus Board Micro App with Work Item inspector, Artifact inspector, Skill rerun, Routine rerun, repository switching, and responsive styling.
- Added aggregation, route, and desktop/mobile browser coverage.
- Validation: 41 unit/route tests passed; typecheck, lint, and production build passed; affected browser cases passed on desktop and mobile.
- Known unrelated caveat: the existing workspace-switcher reload browser test fails on desktop/mobile when local repository state accumulates between tests, matching issue 21.
