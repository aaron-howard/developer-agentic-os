# 46: Local Data Export And Selective Import

**What to build:** A developer can generate a reviewable Migration Package, inspect its contents, select repositories and records, import them into a private Workspace, preserve relationships, and receive explicit warnings for legacy or missing provenance.

**Blocked by:** 45: Hosted Domain Persistence

**Status:** closed

- [x] Local state can be exported into a reviewable package without credentials.
- [x] The package lists repositories, records, relationships, provenance, and legacy-data warnings.
- [x] A developer can select repositories and records for import.
- [x] Imported records map local path-derived identities to explicit hosted identities.
- [x] Relationships and provenance are preserved; missing provenance is reported.
- [x] Repeated or interrupted imports are safe and do not duplicate records.
- [x] Unit, route, and browser tests cover export review, selective import, retry, and isolation.

## Completion

Implemented with versioned reviewable migration packages, selective repository
and record import, relationship remapping, provenance warnings, and idempotent
retry behavior.
