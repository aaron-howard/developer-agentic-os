## Question

What implementation sequence and validation suite should be used once all first-build decisions are resolved?

Produce the final build handoff: ordered implementation tasks, files/modules to create or migrate, tests to port or write, and browser checks for the approved UI.

## Resolution Comment

Created the final implementation handoff at `docs/implementation-plan-and-validation-strategy.md`.

The handoff defines the Next.js App Router implementation sequence, TypeScript module boundaries, Local Store layout, route handler targets, live versus placeholder widgets, tests to port/write, browser smoke checks, and suggested implementation tickets.

It also resolves the remaining fog: user-added micro app persistence is deferred from the first build. The first build may show a static placeholder micro-app catalog, while persisted user-added micro apps move to a later effort.
